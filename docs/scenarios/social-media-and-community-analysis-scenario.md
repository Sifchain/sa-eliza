# Social Media and Community Analysis Scenario

## Overview
This scenario involves an AI agent performing a comprehensive analysis of social media and online community activity related to a specific topic, project, or token. By leveraging APIs and data from platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and Reddit, the agent tracks sentiment, identifies key influencers, evaluates community engagement, and detects potential manipulation attempts.
