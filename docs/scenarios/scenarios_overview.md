# Scenarios Overview

Scenarios in the Reality Spiral ecosystem serve as a powerful framework for testing, exploring, and enhancing the behavior of agents. They combine elements of narrative development, technical validation, and emergent interaction, acting as both advanced integration tests and narrative extensions. This document outlines their purpose, structure, and potential applications within the Reality Spiral ecosystem.

## What is a Scenario?

A **scenario** is a structured sequence of interactions and events designed to:

- Test and validate agent behavior in specific contexts.
- Demonstrate the capabilities and narrative alignment of agents.
- Explore emergent behaviors and interactions between agents, users, and external systems.

### Key Components

1. **Objectives:**
   - Define the desired outcomes or goals of the scenario.
   - Objectives can be specific (e.g., "agent completes a transaction") or open-ended (e.g., "agent engages in a meaningful dialogue").

2. **Participants:**
   - The agents, users, and external systems involved.
   - Roles and configurations for each participant are specified, including agent character files and initial parameters.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The starting state of the environment, including:
     - Pre-loaded data (e.g., conversation history, knowledge base).
     - Relationships between agents or users.
     - Simulated external conditions (e.g., market data, platform states).

4. **Expected Actions:**
   - Actions or sequences agents are expected to perform, such as completing tasks or responding to specific stimuli.

5. **Success Criteria:**
   - The conditions that define a successful scenario run.
   - Criteria can be quantitative (e.g., task completion) or qualitative (e.g., maintaining persona consistency).

6. **Data Collection Requirements:**
   - Specifies the data to be logged during a scenario, such as:
     - Agent actions.
     - Internal state changes.
     - Interaction history.
     - Performance metrics.

7. **Relationship to Lore:**
   - Scenarios may integrate or expand upon the Reality Spiral lore, enriching the narrative experience.

## What is a Run?

A **run** is a single execution of a scenario. It involves setting up the scenario, simulating interactions, and evaluating agent behavior.

### Run Lifecycle
1. **Initialization:**
   - Set up the environment and load initial conditions.
2. **Execution:**
   - Simulate the scenario and trigger agent actions.
3. **Monitoring:**
   - Track events, log data, and observe interactions.
4. **Termination:**
   - End the run based on predefined criteria (e.g., time limit, task completion).
5. **Evaluation:**
   - Analyze data to assess performance and identify improvements.

### Run Parameters
- **Time Constraints:** Specify duration (real-time, accelerated, fixed).
- **Resource Limits:** Define computational or token usage limits.
- **Randomization Factors:** Introduce controlled randomness to test adaptability.

### Types of Runs
- **Internal/Controlled:** Conducted by developers for testing and debugging.
- **Open/Community:** Involve external users, fostering realistic and diverse interactions.

## Relationship to the Eliza Framework

Scenarios and runs are deeply integrated with Eliza’s core components:

1. **Actions:** Scenarios often involve triggering specific agent actions and evaluating their outcomes.
2. **Providers:** Provide real-time data and set up initial conditions (e.g., market data, user interactions).
3. **Evaluators:** Assess agent performance and behavior based on predefined criteria.
4. **Memory:** Utilize and modify agent memory, testing recall and learning.
5. **Clients:** Test agent interactions across platforms (e.g., Discord, Twitter).
6. **Plugins:** Extend agent capabilities within scenarios by adding new actions, providers, and evaluators.

## Use Cases for Scenarios

### 1. **Agent Testing and Validation**
- Validate agent capabilities under specific conditions.
- Identify and resolve bugs or inconsistencies in behavior.

### 2. **Emergent Behavior Exploration**
- Create environments for unexpected agent behaviors and interactions to emerge.
- Gain insights into agent dynamics and adaptability.

### 3. **Narrative Development**
- Use scenarios to advance the Reality Spiral lore.
- Develop agent personas and motivations through decision-making challenges.

### 4. **Community Engagement**
- Design scenarios to involve users in agent development and narrative creation.
- Foster collaboration between agents, users, and developers.

### 5. **Training and Fine-Tuning**
- Generate data from scenarios to improve AI models.
- Fine-tune agent responses and behaviors based on scenario outcomes.

### 6. **Integration Testing**
- Test agent interactions with external systems (e.g., GitHub, Coinbase).
- Ensure seamless functionality across multiple platforms.

## Long-Term Vision for Scenarios

Scenarios represent a vital intersection of technical validation and narrative expansion in the Reality Spiral. Their design and implementation enable:

1. **Advanced Agent Capabilities:** Agents that evolve and adapt through iterative testing and real-world application.
2. **Immersive User Experiences:** Engaging narratives that blend technical achievements with storytelling.
3. **Collaborative Ecosystems:** A unified framework where developers, users, and agents work together to shape the Spiral’s evolution.

By acting as both integration tests and narrative tools, scenarios provide a robust, versatile framework for exploring the limitless potential of Reality Spiral agents.
