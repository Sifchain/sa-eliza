# Codebase Research Scenario

## Overview
This scenario involves an AI agent conducting comprehensive research on a specific GitHub project. The agent will evaluate the codebase, analyze commit history, assess contributor activity, review documentation, identify dependencies, and compare the project to similar codebases. Additionally, the agent will examine GitHub issues and test coverage to provide a detailed assessment of the project’s quality, feasibility, and velocity.

## Scenario Components

### Objectives
- Analyze the quality and structure of the project’s codebase.
- Evaluate commit history and contributor activity.
- Review project documentation and assess its completeness and clarity.
- Identify and evaluate dependencies for stability and potential risks.
- Assess test coverage and highlight areas for improvement.
- Review GitHub issues to evaluate project velocity and key concerns.
- Compare the project to similar codebases to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.

### Participants
- **Primary Agent:** The AI agent responsible for conducting the research.
- **External Systems:** GitHub repository data, dependency information, and documentation files.
- **Users (Optional):** Developers or stakeholders who will review the agent’s findings.

### Initial Conditions
- Access to the target GitHub repository, including:
  - Codebase and commit history.
  - Documentation files (e.g., README, API guides).
  - Open and closed issues.
  - Test files and coverage reports.
  - Dependency manifest (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
- Contextual knowledge of similar projects or benchmarks for comparison.

### Expected Actions
1. **Code Quality Analysis:**
   - Assess structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.
   - Identify potential areas for refactoring or improvement.
2. **Commit History Analysis:**
   - Analyze commit frequency, volume, and patterns to gauge project activity.
   - Evaluate individual contributor activity and consistency.
3. **Documentation Review:**
   - Assess the completeness, clarity, and accuracy of documentation.
   - Identify missing or outdated sections that require attention.
4. **Dependency Analysis:**
   - Review external dependencies for stability, licensing concerns, and versioning.
   - Highlight potential risks or outdated packages.
5. **Test Coverage Evaluation:**
   - Analyze test files and reports to assess coverage levels.
   - Identify untested areas and recommend test improvements.
6. **Issue Review:**
   - Examine open and closed issues to identify key concerns and blockers.
   - Evaluate project velocity by analyzing issue resolution trends.
7. **Comparison to Similar Projects:**
   - Compare the target project to similar codebases in terms of features, quality, and community activity.
   - Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation.

### Success Criteria
- Comprehensive analysis of the target project is completed and documented.
- Actionable insights and recommendations are provided for all areas evaluated.
- Comparisons to similar projects yield meaningful conclusions about strengths and weaknesses.
- Data collected is logged for future reference and learning.

## Run Lifecycle

### Initialization
- Set up the agent’s environment, including:
  - Loading access credentials for GitHub.
  - Preloading knowledge of best practices and benchmarks.
- Fetch all relevant data from the target repository, including code, commits, issues, and documentation.

### Execution
- Perform the steps outlined in the **Expected Actions** section sequentially.
- Simulate user interactions (e.g., querying for clarifications on specific issues).

### Monitoring
- Track the agent’s progress and log key actions, findings, and decisions.
- Monitor resource usage (e.g., API call limits, computation time).

### Termination
- End the run when all objectives are met or after a predefined time limit.
- Generate a detailed report summarizing the findings and recommendations.

### Evaluation
- Assess the quality and completeness of the agent’s analysis.
- Verify that actionable recommendations align with project goals.
- Identify any gaps or areas for improvement in the agent’s approach.

---

## Run Parameters
- **Time Constraints:** Ensure the analysis is completed within a set time frame.
- **Resource Limits:** Limit API calls to avoid rate-limiting or excessive costs.
- **Randomization Factors:** Introduce variability in test scenarios (e.g., comparing to different benchmark projects).

---

## Data Collection Requirements
- Logs of all actions and findings.
- Details of code quality issues, commit patterns, and contributor activity.
- Documentation gaps and areas requiring updates.
- Test coverage metrics and identified gaps.
- Dependency risks and recommendations.
- Insights from issue analysis and velocity metrics.
- Comparative analysis with similar projects.

---

## Integration with Eliza Framework
- **Actions:** Use GitHub plugin actions like `ANALYZE_CODE`, `GET_COMMIT_HISTORY`, `FETCH_ISSUES`, and `COMPARE_PROJECTS`.
- **Providers:** Leverage providers for real-time data retrieval from GitHub and dependency registries.
- **Evaluators:** Assess findings using evaluators for code quality, test coverage, and project activity.
- **Memory:** Log findings in the agent’s memory for future reference and refinement.

---

## Expected Impact
- Provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the target project.
- Identify actionable improvements to enhance code quality, documentation, and overall project health.
- Highlight competitive advantages and opportunities through benchmarking.
- Enable continuous improvement by integrating findings into future scenarios and agent capabilities.
