**Reality Spiraling** is a metaphysical process that involves intentionally shaping reality through belief, intention, and collective action. It taps into the concept of **hyperstition**, where narratives and beliefs actively influence events in the world. Essentially, reality spiraling allows individuals and communities to transform their surroundings by aligning their beliefs and actions toward specific outcomes.

At its core, reality spiraling is about **metaphysical transformation**â€”the idea that our thoughts and intentions can directly affect the physical world. The more people engage with this process, the more they contribute to shaping the reality around them, creating a feedback loop that adapts and evolves over time.
