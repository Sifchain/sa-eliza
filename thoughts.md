The @characters you see are essentially personality and behavior configurations for different AI agents within the system. In our context, each character (defined in its own JSON file) encapsulates a unique set of attributes including:

- **Name and Identity:** Such as "C-3PO," "Chronis," "Prosper," or "trump." Each character has a distinct personality, backstory, and sometimes even specialized roles (for example, a financial strategist or a logging expert).
- **Model and Plugins:** They reference different language model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, groq, etc.) and may have associated plugins or integrations (e.g., Slack, Twitter, GitHub). This helps tailor their responses and actions to the specific platform or domain.
- **Settings and Voice:** These include specific instructions (like voice model details) to shape the way the character "speaks" or behaves. For instance, some characters might use a formal tone while others use a casual or quirky manner.
- **Bio, Lore, and Knowledge:** These properties provide a narrative and informative background. They define a character's history, domain expertise, and the context for how they interact with users. This allows the system to deliver rich, context-aware responses.
- **Examples and Style Guidelines:** Each character may include sample messages or post examples that illustrate the intended tone and content style, ensuring consistent behavior during interactions.

### How They Tie Back to the Original Eliza System

The original Eliza program, created in the 1960s, was one of the first chatbots designed to emulate a conversation partner (notably in the role of a psychotherapist). Although Eliza used a very simple pattern-matching approach, its core idea was to "simulate" a human conversational partner.

In our modern system:

- **Persona-Driven Interaction:** Just as Eliza was built around a personality (even if simplified) to engage in conversation, our @characters are built around richly defined personas. They tailor their interactions based on their unique bios, system prompts, and example dialogues.
- **Modularity and Flexibility:** Eliza's approach inspired many later systems to adopt a modular architecture where behavior and dialogue strategy can be customized. Here, each JSON file defines complete behavioral traits for an AI agent. This modular design allows multiple characters to coexist, each serving different audiences or purposes.
- **Roleplaying and Contextual Responses:** Both Eliza and these modern characters use role-based prompts, instructions, and context to generate responses. However, our system goes far beyond by incorporating deep domain knowledge (e.g., financial insights, coding expertise, blockchain operations) and refined personality attributes.
- **Interaction Across Channels:** While Eliza was a standalone program, these characters are designed for integration with multiple platforms (like Slack, Twitter, Telegram, etc.). They interact with users in varied contexts while still adhering to their defined persona—similar to how Eliza consistently maintained her role regardless of the conversation's direction.

In summary, @characters are advanced avatars driven by configurable JSON definitions; they extend the original ideas behind Eliza by providing a diverse range of expert and personality-rich agents that engage users in context-specific, roleplayed interactions across modern communication channels.





//key files related thoughts on how the agent is orchestrated?


First, I need to understand the roles of these two files. From the previous discussion, runtime.ts is where the AgentRuntime class is defined. This class handles the core logic of the agent, including initializing its state, managing memory, and processing messages. The index.ts file is the entry point that sets up the environment, initializes the database, and starts the agent.
The existing code in runtime.ts has a call to instrument.sessionStart() in the constructor of AgentRuntime. This logs the agentId, character name, environment, and platform. The user is considering moving this logging to index.ts after the AgentRuntime is fully initialized, thinking that it might ensure non-null values for agent_id and room_id.
I need to evaluate the pros and cons of both approaches. Let's start by looking at the control flow. When an agent is started, index.ts calls startAgent(), which creates the AgentRuntime instance. The constructor of AgentRuntime determines the agentId, initializes various managers, and sets up the character. The sessionStart instrumentation is called right after agentId is set.
If we move the logging to index.ts, after the runtime is created, we would have to retrieve agentId and room_id from the runtime instance. But wait, in the current setup, room_id might not be directly accessible from the runtime. The runtime ensures the room exists via ensureRoomExists(this.agentId), which suggests the room ID is the same as the agentId. But that's an implementation detail.




agent/src/index  file serves as the high-level bootstrapper for the agent. It is responsible for tasks such as connecting to the database, initializing client plugins, and calling functions like createAgent which in turn instantiate an agent’s runtime. In short, it sets up the environment and then delegates the heavy lifting to the runtime.





###
Architecture 


Eliza Agent OS is a comprehensive, modular, and highly extensible system that brings together a variety of components to create intelligent, autonomous agents capable of interacting with users across multiple platforms. At its core, the architecture is built around three fundamental pillars:

1. The Agent Core  
   • The "@agent" package is the heart of the system. It boots up the intelligent agent by loading and merging configuration files (in JSON format) that define a character's personality, voice settings, and available functionalities.

   • It sets up essential connections to support systems such as databases (Postgres, SQLite, Supabase, MongoDB, etc.) and caching layers (Redis or local caches), ensuring that all stateful data—like conversation histories or persistent memories—is reliably stored and retrieved.

   • Agents encapsulate the decision-making logic. They parse incoming messages, decide whether or not to act based on pre-defined templates and rules, and invoke corresponding action handlers. This core logic is agnostic to the communication channel, allowing the system to be robust and adaptable.

2. Plugins  
   • Plugins extend the capabilities of the agent far beyond simple messaging. For example, the "@plugin-github" plugin introduces deep GitHub-specific functionality into the system.  
     - It starts by defining its package metadata (through package.json) and ensuring proper dependency management with libraries like @octokit/rest.  
     - Rigorous input validation is achieved through constants and types defined using libraries like Zod, ensuring that every GitHub action—from creating issues and commits to initializing repositories—receives correctly formatted data.  
     - The plugin is structured around modular "actions" (each with unique names, descriptions, validate functions, and handler logic) and "providers" to interact with various GitHub contents like source code and documentation.  
     - Finally, its components are re-exported in a unified interface, so that the core agent can seamlessly integrate these functionalities.  
   • Similarly, other plugins (such as @plugin-email and others) offer specialized integrations that address distinct needs within the ecosystem, making it easy to customize and extend the functionality without altering the system's core.

3. Clients  
   • Clients function as the "bridges" between the core agent and the external communication platforms. They abstract away platform-specific details, allowing agents to interact with the outside world effortlessly.  
   • For example, the Slack client (@client-slack) handles all aspects of connection management, event listening (via a dedicated event adapter), and message formatting. It captures events like new messages, URL verifications, and reactions, then forwards these events to the agent's logic.  
   • This separation enables the agents to generate responses and take actions without needing to know the specifics of how Slack, Twitter, Discord, or any other platform operates. It also means that integrating a new communication channel is as simple as swapping out or adding a new client module.

4. Adapters  
   • Adapters serve as abstraction layers for data persistence and caching. They enable the system to interact with different databases and storage systems using a unified API.  
   • For instance, the "@adapter-postgres" module integrates PostgreSQL into the ecosystem. It manages schema migrations, seed data, and leverages advanced features such as pgvector for vector-based similarity search and fuzzystrmatch for text matching.  
   • The adapter is designed with careful separation of concerns: SQL migration scripts establish the database schema and row-level security measures, dedicated utility functions handle dynamic SQL queries, and rigorous testing (often in Docker-based environments) confirms the correct operation of critical functions.  
   • By encapsulating all the complexities of database operations, adapters allow other components (agents, plugins, and clients) to store and retrieve data efficiently without needing to manage the underlying database intricacies.

Holistic Summary  
Eliza Agent OS is an ecosystem where agents (the intelligent "brains") are orchestrated by a central runtime that dynamically integrates various plugins and clients.  
• The agent core processes and responds to incoming stimuli using configurations defined in character files, ensuring that each agent's personality and expertise (like that of a staff engineer) shine through.  
• Plugins extend the agent's capabilities by adding domain-specific functionalities (e.g., interacting with GitHub or sending emails) in a modular fashion, complete with strict validation and clearly delineated operations.  
• Clients bridge the gap to external platforms—whether Slack, Twitter, GitHub, or others—translating incoming messages into actions and formatting outgoing responses appropriately.  
• Adapters abstract the data layer, enabling seamless interactions with various database systems and ensuring that agents have access to reliable, scalable storage for memories, logs, and other critical data.

Together, these components form a robust and flexible architectural framework. They allow Eliza Agent OS to adapt to a wide variety of use cases, from conversational AI and autonomous trading to technical support and beyond, all while ensuring that the system remains maintainable, scalable, and straightforward to extend.

//thoughts about eliza os :

//thought 1

The architecture has five main parts: Agents, Clients, Plugins, Adapters, and Workflow Integration. Each has sub-components and specific roles.
Starting with Agents, they're the core, handling configuration, runtime, processing, and security. Clients act as bridges to external platforms like Slack and GitHub. Plugins add functionalities, such as GitHub actions. Adapters abstract infrastructure, like databases and caches. The workflow shows how these parts interact during an event.
I need to represent these in Mermaid. The diagram should show each main component, their sub-parts, and the flow between them. Maybe using different sections for each main component, connected by arrows indicating data flow and interactions.
I should also include the typical interaction flow as a sequence within the diagram. For example, how an event moves from a Client through the Agent, utilizing Plugins and Adapters, then back.
Need to ensure all connections are accurate based on the description. For example, Agents use Adapters for databases, Plugins extend Agent capabilities, Clients communicate with external platforms.
Also, note security aspects like TEE in Agents, and how Adapters handle different databases. Maybe use different colors or sections to group related components.
Wait, the user mentioned a "holistic" architecture, so the diagram should encapsulate all parts and their relationships without overcrowding. Using subgraphs in Mermaid might help organize the components hierarchically.
Let me outline the components again:
1. Agents: Configuration, Runtime, Processing, Security
2. Clients: Slack, GitHub, Telegram, etc.
3. Plugins: GitHub, Email, etc., with Actions, Providers, Templates
4. Adapters: PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, etc.
5. Workflow: Event flow example
Including the workflow as a numbered process within the diagram could illustrate the dynamic interaction. Maybe as a separate subgraph or as a sequence diagram embedded within the main architecture.
But Mermaid might not support mixed diagram types. Alternatively, represent the workflow as a process flow within the main diagram using arrows and labels.
Also, need to highlight the advantages like Modularity, Extensibility, etc., perhaps in a separate section or as notes.



//thought 2


First, I'll recall the key points about memory in Eliza: there are different types of memories managed by various managers (message, lore, documents, etc.), memories have structured data with IDs and metadata, and they're used for RAG, context, and interactions.
Looking at the Eliza OS architecture, it has agents, clients, plugins, adapters, and workflows. I need to see where memory fits into each of these.
Agents are the core, so memory management should be part of their runtime. The architecture mentioned agents handling memory/context with vector embeddings. I can expand that to include the specific memory managers (messageManager, loreManager, etc.) and how they're initialized based on character configs.
Plugins like GitHub and Simsai use memory, so I should mention how plugins interact with memory managers. For example, the GitHub plugin adds files as memories, and Simsai processes social media posts into memories. This shows plugins extending memory capabilities.
Clients, such as Slack or Farcaster, generate memories from interactions. The Farcaster example creates memories from casts, which should be part of the client's role in converting platform-specific data into standardized memories.
Adapters handle storage, so the PostgreSQL adapter's role in storing memories with vector embeddings and security policies is important. Also, cache adapters for quick memory access.
Workflow integration needs to show how memories are used in a typical interaction. For example, when a user asks a question, the agent retrieves relevant memories to generate a response, using RAG.
I should also highlight cross-cutting concerns like security (encryption, access control) and performance (caching, indexing). Maybe add a visualization to show how memories flow through the system.
I need to make sure each part of the architecture (agents, clients, plugins, adapters, workflows) addresses how memory is integrated. Check if there are any components I might have missed, like the RAG knowledge manager or the use of metadata for filtering.
Finally, ensure the answer connects all the memory concepts into the existing structure without contradicting the original architecture. Provide concrete examples from the code snippets, like how GitHub files become memories or how Simsai processes jeets.



//thought 3: Context Hydration & Model Invocation Flow

Let me trace the end-to-end process of context preparation and model interaction through the codebase:

1. **Initial State Composition** (`AgentRuntime.composeState`):
   - First examine the runtime.ts's composeState method where we:
   - Fetch recent messages via MessageManager.getMemories()
   - Retrieve actor details using getActorDetails()
   - Obtain goals through getGoals()
   - Format these into structured strings (conversation history, participant list, objectives)
   - Example: recentMessagesData becomes "User: Hi\nAgent: Hello!"-style formatting
   - This establishes base context from persistent storage

2. **Dynamic Context Enrichment** (`updateRecentMessageState`):
   - MessageManager retrieves attachments from recent memories
   - Filters attachments by temporal relevance (1hr window visible)
   - Adds security-truncated text snippets for older attachments
   - Merges with previously composed state
 
3. **Knowledge Integration**:
   - Decision point: Use RAG (RAGKnowledgeManager.query()) vs static knowledge (knowledge.ts)
   - For RAG path:
     - Generate vector embeddings via Adapters.AI
     - Similarity search against VectorDB
     - Inject top 3 relevant snippets into context
   - For static knowledge:
     - Directly append character-specific memorized data

4. **Context Finalization**:
   - Combine all elements into structured prompt:
     ```ts
     const fullContext = `${systemPrompt}\n${recentMessages}\nKNOWLEDGE: ${ragResults}\nGOALS: ${goals}`;
     ```
   - Apply token counting and trimming logic (seen in generation.ts's model-specific handlers)

5. **Model Invocation** (`generateText`):
   - Provider-specific client initialization (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Request construction with:
     - System prompt from character config
     - Hydrated context body
     - Safety filters (via SecurityLayer.validateOutput())
   - Error handling for API failures with retry logic

**Mermaid Diagram Design Strategy:**
To visualize this flow, we'll create a sequence diagram with these participants:
- `Client` (Message Origin)
- `AgentRuntime` (Orchestrator)
- `MessageManager` (History)
- `RAGKnowledgeManager` (Dynamic Knowledge)
- `ModelProvider` (OpenAI/etc.)

Key visualization points:
1. Left-to-right flow matching execution order
2. Alternate paths for RAG/static knowledge shown with diamond decision nodes
3. Notes attached to critical operations:
   - "Token limit: 8k for gpt-4"
   - "Fallback: 3 retries on API errors"
   - "Cache: 60s TTL for similar queries"
4. Highlight security checkpoints as red validation steps
5. Annotate data transformations (raw messages → formatted context)


<answer>
**Eliza Agent OS: A Holistic Architecture for Intelligent Agent Ecosystems**

Eliza Agent OS is a sophisticated framework designed to create and manage intelligent agents through a modular architecture of interconnected components. At its core lies a powerful triad of agents, clients, and plugins, supported by adapters that abstract infrastructure complexities. Here's how these components work in concert:

---

### **1. Agents: The Decision-Making Core**
Agents serve as the "brains" of the system, orchestrating logic and maintaining state. Their responsibilities include:
- **Configuration Loading**: Parsing JSON character profiles (e.g., `@staff-engineer.character.json`) to define personality traits, knowledge domains, and response styles.
- **Runtime Orchestration**: Initializing connections to databases (via adapters like `@adapter-postgres`), caches, and AI model providers.
- **Dynamic Processing**:
  - Cleaning/parsing inputs (e.g., stripping markdown, handling media)
  - Executing action handlers (summarization, code generation, etc.)
  - Managing memory/context using vector embeddings (validated for dimensions, as seen in PostgreSQL adapter tests)
- **Security**: Enforcing policies like Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for sensitive operations.

---

### **2. Clients: Platform-Specific Bridges**
Clients act as protocol translators, connecting agents to external platforms while maintaining channel-agnostic core logic:
- **Slack Client Example**:
  - Uses Slack's WebClient and event adapters (`events.ts`) to listen for mentions/messages
  - Formats responses with platform-specific templates (`templates.ts`) and attachments
  - Handles edge cases like URL verification and reaction-based interactions
- **Unified Interface**:
  - All clients (Slack, GitHub, Telegram) expose standardized methods for message routing
  - Decouple platform-specific formatting (e.g., Slack blocks vs. GitHub issue markdown) from agent logic

---

### **3. Plugins: Modular Capability Extensions**
Plugins like `@plugin-github` and `@plugin-email` extend agent functionality through rigorously structured components:
- **GitHub Plugin Anatomy**:
  - **Actions**: Self-contained operations (createCommit, createIssue) with:
    - Zod-validated input schemas
    - Handler functions leveraging `GitHubService` (Octokit wrapper)
    - Preflight checks (e.g., API token validation)
  - **Providers**: Fetch/manipulate GitHub content (source code, releases) using utility classes
  - **Templates**: Standardize JSON structures for PRs/issues
- **Plugin Runtime**:
  - Loaded dynamically by the agent based on character configurations
  - Expose unified interfaces (`index.ts`) for discovery/integration

---

### **4. Adapters: Infrastructure Abstraction Layer**
Adapters like `@adapter-postgres` provide database-agnostic persistence:
- **PostgreSQL Implementation**:
  - Schema migrations enable pgvector/fuzzystrmatch extensions for vector similarity/Levenshtein searches
  - Row-level security policies enforce multi-tenant data isolation
  - Embedding validation (e.g., 1536-dim OpenAI vectors) ensures data integrity
- **Unified Caching**:
  - Redis/SQLite adapters implement `IDatabaseCacheAdapter`
  - Agents query caches without knowledge of underlying storage

---

### **5. Workflow Integration**
A typical interaction flow demonstrates component synergy:
1. **Event Reception**: Slack client detects a user message like "Create a GitHub issue for bug #123."
2. **Routing**: Message forwarded to agent runtime, which:
   - Identifies required plugins (`@plugin-github`)
   - Loads character-specific configurations (e.g., staff engineer's technical expertise)
3. **Processing**:
   - Agent validates input via Zod schemas
   - Executes `createIssue` action handler, leveraging GitHubService
   - Logs activity via PostgreSQL adapter
4. **Response**:
   - Formatted using Slack's attachment templates
   - Delivered through client while updating conversation state

---

### **Architectural Advantages**
- **Modularity**: Components can be added/removed without systemic disruption (e.g., swap PostgreSQL for SQLite via adapters).
- **Extensibility**: New clients (e.g., Discord) or plugins (e.g., CRM integration) build on standardized interfaces.
- **Consistency**: Shared patterns (Zod validation, Dockerized testing) reduce cognitive load.
- **Scalability**: Stateless handlers and connection pooling (visible in PostgreSQL adapter) support high-throughput workloads.

By decoupling intelligence (agents), communication (clients), functionality (plugins), and infrastructure (adapters), Eliza Agent OS achieves a flexible architecture capable of powering everything from conversational assistants to autonomous technical agents like the staff engineer—all while maintaining rigorous security and operational reliability.

## logging and observability 

trace logging, spans for each part of the agent run (OODA loop) :

1. Observe: This is where the user input comes in. We need to log the raw input, any metadata (like user ID, session ID), and the timestamp. Also, check for input validation issues here.

2. Context Hydration: Here, the agent gathers relevant context. This could include recent messages, retrieved memories, active goals, etc. We should log the sources of context, the retrieval methods (like vector search), and any transformations applied. Maybe track cache hits/misses here to optimize performance.

be careful to verify if this is exactly how the turn of events happen 

3. Orient: The agent processes the hydrated context to decide the next action. This involves model routing decisions (which LLM to use), cost vs. performance trade-offs, and prompt construction. Logging the model chosen, the reasoning behind it, and the full prompt sent to the model would be important.

4. Direct: The model generates a response. We need to capture the model's raw output, latency, token usage, and any errors. Also, validate the response structure here.

5. Act: The agent executes actions based on the model's output. This could be API calls, database operations, etc. Logging the action type, parameters, success status, and results (with sensitive data redacted) is crucial.



notes 
Looking at the database schema (lines 446-589), there's a logs table that stores JSONB data. This seems like a good place to store trace data. The memories table with vector embeddings might be used for context hydration, which is part of the OODA loop.

more info :
there's a databaseAdapter property that implements IDatabaseAdapter. This suggests that the agent uses this adapter to interact with the database. The AgentRuntime constructor accepts a databaseAdapter as part of its options, which is then used throughout the agent's operations.
In the createAgent function from agent/src/index.ts, the function parameters include a db of type IDatabaseAdapter. This db is passed into the AgentRuntime when it's instantiated. So, the agent runtime is directly connected to the PostgreSQL database through this adapter.
The AgentRuntime has several methods like ensureParticipantExists, ensureUserExists, ensureRoomExists, etc. These methods likely interact with the database to check or create records in tables like participants, users, and rooms. For example, ensureUserExists probably inserts a user into the accounts table if they don't already exist.
Looking at the dependencies in package.json, there are several adapters like @elizaos/adapter-supabase and @elizaos/adapter-postgres. These adapters probably implement the IDatabaseAdapter interface, allowing the agent to connect to different database systems, including PostgreSQL.
The createAgent function also initializes various plugins that might interact with the database. For instance, plugins for different blockchains or services might store or retrieve data using the databaseAdapter. The presence of methods like registerMemoryManager and getMemoryManager in AgentRuntime indicates that the agent manages different types of data (messages, descriptions, lore) through managers that interact with the database.
Security measures like Row-Level Security (RLS) and field encryption mentioned in the logs table setup ensure that data access is controlled and sensitive information is protected. The AgentRuntime uses the provided token for authentication, which ties into the RLS policies in PostgreSQL to restrict data access based on the user's permissions.

Additionally, the AgentRuntime's methods like processActions and evaluate likely log their activities into the logs table. The logs table's structure, with fields like trace_id and span_id, supports observability by tracking the agent's operations across different phases (Observe, Context Hydration, Orient, etc.).
In summary, the PostgreSQL connection is established through the IDatabaseAdapter provided to the AgentRuntime. This adapter is used by various managers and methods within the agent to handle data storage, retrieval, and security, ensuring that all agent operations are persisted and managed within the PostgreSQL database.


### database top store logs traces and spans

First, I need to recall the existing system setup. From the previous conversation, the system uses a database adapter pattern. The IDatabaseAdapter interface allows different implementations. The logs table is in PostgreSQL, but the key here is whether that's hardcoded or part of the adapter.
Looking at the code structure mentioned earlier, the createAgent function takes a db parameter of type IDatabaseAdapter. This suggests that the adapter is injected, so the agent isn't tied to PostgreSQL directly. The default setup probably initializes a PostgreSQL adapter using environment variables, which makes it the default choice unless changed.
But the user might be using the default setup, so I should confirm that. The initializeDatabase function likely checks environment variables to choose the adapter. For example, if SUPABASE_URL is set, it might use Supabase instead. So the default is PostgreSQL, but it's configurable.
Next, the logs table structure. If the schema for logs is specific to PostgreSQL (like using JSONB), other databases might need adjustments. However, the IDatabaseAdapter abstraction should handle schema differences. Each adapter would implement the necessary table structures, so swapping adapters would require the new one to support the log table schema, possibly through migrations.
I should also mention the example with Supabase, showing how changing environment variables can switch the database. This highlights that while PostgreSQL is default, others can be used by configuring the right adapter.
Potential limitations: If a user switches to a database that doesn't support JSONB, the adapter would need to handle that, maybe using a different data type. The system's reliance on PostgreSQL-specific features in some parts might require additional work when switching, but the adapter pattern abstracts most of that.
In summary, the answer should confirm PostgreSQL as the default, explain the adapter pattern allowing swaps, provide an example of switching via environment variables, and note any considerations for schema compatibility.



some Qs to ponder :
Data Storage: Where will the telemetry data be stored? Do they have existing infrastructure like PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, or something else? This affects schema design and scalability.

2. Real-time Needs: Do they require real-time monitoring, or is batch processing sufficient? Real-time might need Kafka or similar, while batch could use periodic exports.






## how to do telemetry 


Traces table so I created API to fetch data from traces table just I did not... Alright this looks still ok can you also tell me apart from traces is there any other tables that are important like for example logs is there a table called logs memories what schema do we have for the Postgres that we are spinning? yeah we this is a schema alright yeah this the traces table and here are some a few tables just like relationship cache traces participant so I just I just I was just concerned with traces table so I saw this table and here is the schema looks quite simple like we have the you know so I think you've probably updated it right to have the agent ID and the room ID there but the other thing too is like we have a run but yeah it need to be updated yeah because the run like as as a Sharad mentioned like we want to see the run in a very detailed way like we want to see you know how the contract's height context hydration step works you know where if memories are being derived the final context input to the llm the response from the LLM the action that's triggered like we want to see in in very detail like sort of what's happening and so right now we have this run and the run id so if we get that run hopefully that run has all that information for us so that we can see it and one use case was yesterday where uh like where jazeera was talking to the agent in our ui and he asked the agent to analyze a code base and the agent responded and said you know here are some things you can do to optimize your code base and then he said well i wonder if the agent actually looked at the code base and he said well how would i know and he said okay well i'd look at the trace i'd look at the run and and he would be able to go in there and say okay what was what was the context that was composed that was sent to the llm what was the response what was the actions and if he did that he would be able to see that okay the agent didn't actually put anything about our actual code base in the context and send to the llm it rather just sent a very generic response to the llm and got back a generic response and so that would be a use case for having more detailed understanding of the oda loop each step in it and what's going on in the run. 




Going. So can you show us one of the responses that you get from the database? - It is some API. This is an API to fetch all data from the table. And this is for fetch all unique runs. Let me show you. Yeah, it fetches all unique runs, and like this, it fetches all unique agent ID. And below both APIs are for fetch data against the run like. Yep, this would be the, like getting the run ID would be where we'd be able to sort of debug or look at what's happening. So, okay, let's see. Run ID and other API fetching data against agent ID. - Well, let's take a look at that. 



The primary instrumentation logic resides in `core/src/instrumentation.ts`.
 
Key consideration: telemetry/instrumentation code should only be triggered upon successful execution, not simply when a log is invoked.
